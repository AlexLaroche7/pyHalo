pyHalo is a tool for rendering full substructure mass distributions for gravitational lensing simulations. It is intended for use with the open source gravitational lensing software package lenstronomy (https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy). 

This code is under active development, but the core functionality expressed in the example notebook is stable and well tested. 

If you would like to use this package and have questions, please get in touch with me at gilman@astro.utoronto.ca - I am happy to help!

Features
--------

- Quickly rendering full populations of dark matter subhalos and line of sight halos for gravitational lensing simulations
- Translte halo properties (mass, concentration, redshift, etc) into angular units for lensing computations with lenstronomy

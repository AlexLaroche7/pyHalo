A tool for rendering full substructure mass distributions for gravitational lensing simulations. This package was used to generate subhalo and field halo populations for the following publications: 

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.6077G/abstract

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492L..12G/abstract

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200701308G/abstract

I have put a jupyter notebook in the example_notebook directory that shows a simple usage example, generating a population of CDM halos with a number of default settings. I will add other example notebooks soon that demonstrate how to render halos from other dark matter models.

If you would like to use this package, please get in touch with me at gilman@astro.utoronto.ca - I am happy to help!
